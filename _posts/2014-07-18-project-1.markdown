description: GovLoop was looking to add a learning platform to their WordPress site. The requirement was to make it white-label so they could sell it to clients as well as use a customized version on their own site. I worked on the front end architecture and coded several of the templates along with a large team at 10up. One of the main interactive features is a to-do list style app called the Action Plan. The site is an MVP of a very complex information architecture, but one that I'm very proud to have worked on.
