description: The fellas at Triple Stamp Press needed a website refresh and Team Eight was happy to oblige. I was the lead developer on the project and worked closely with the clients and designer to make it happen. Rather than thinking of TSPâ€™s website as solely a marketing tool, we approached it as a platform for a whole suite of internal and client facing tools. From a pricing calculator to a color coded library of print notes to a simple employee punch clock, this site has changed how Triple Stamp works and is now central to their business.
