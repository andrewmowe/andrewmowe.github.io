description: For the City of Oakland's forthcoming redesign, they wanted a pattern library (aka pattern portfolio, aka styleguide, aka awesomesauce). This is by far my favorite way to start a project so I was thrilled at the opportunity. Working with the designers at <a href="http://www.objectivesubject.com/">Objective Subject</a>, we went above and beyond and delivered a very slick design toolkit. It features code snippets, a visual language guide, and philosophical treatises on the importance of tabs vs. spaces. Here's a link to the <a href="https://design.oaklandca.gov/0/">Pattern Portfolio</a> and the <a href="https://beta.oaklandca.gov/">Beta Site</a>.
