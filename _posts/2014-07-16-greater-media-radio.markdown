description: Greater Media Radio came to 10up to revamp not just one, but dozens of station websites. The migration was very involved but my focus was QA and Front End Development. The key here was reusability, as the basic WordPress theme we built needed to be repurposed for all the other stations to customize the look-and-feel. During the home stretch I came in as additional front end dev help, but I touched almost every aspect of the theme during QA from the very beginning.
