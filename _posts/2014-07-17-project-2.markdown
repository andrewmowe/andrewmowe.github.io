description: E-Health Insurance came to 10up to create a brand new site to serve their Medicare clients. The goal was to create a place for clients to meet and interact with agents asynchronously. I led the front end team and the initial site architecture using WordPress, Sass, Susy, and Grunt. There was a very tight window for launch prior to the Medicare open enrollment season, but the team hit it out of the park and has continued to iterate with updates and improvements ever since.
